# atlas-sorting_algorithms
This is another topic that I feel like would have fit better if we had been taugh it as if it
were something that we needed to be well versed in. Watching a couple of kids doing Bulgarian
folk dances with numbers painted on their chests does not teach me how some of these works
to a comfortable level. I think that Big O notation which is: 
Big O notation tells us how long an algorithm will take to run or how much memory it will use as we give it more and more data. It's like saying, "This algorithm will take no more than a certain amount of time or memory, depending on how much data we give it."
We also were learning four sorting  methods that are as follows.
Bubble Sort-  It repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements, and swaps them if they are in the wrong order until the entire list is sorted.
Insertion Sort-  It builds the sorted list one element at a time by iterating over the unsorted part of the list and inserting each element into its correct position.
Merge Sort- It divides the list into smaller halves, sorts each half individually, and then merges them back together in sorted order.
Quick Sort- It selects a pivot element, partitions the list into two sublists based on the pivot, and recursively sorts each sublist. It's efficient on average but can have poor performance in the worst case.
